        <div class="artworks">
            
            <p> The purpose of this website is to describe the creation process of Internet Artworks and to gain knowledge about the theoretical frameworks introduced in the 
                interactive media 4 course. A selection of blog posts is available to offer feedback and reflect on the most important technical and creative components of the 
                website. Towards the end, the website aims to achieve creative and systematic coherence in all aspects of its design to display critical engagement with the 
                course and allow it to be considered a creative piece in itself. In future development and upcoming assessments, new artistic components will be introduced using the 
                React library to meaningfully tie the website together as a whole. The current experimental artwork provides a simple overview for the artistic direction of the website. The 
                sample below illustrates the current artistic direction of the website and artworks planned for future implementation. These artworks will use transformative gradients 
                to create mesmerizing effects for the user to experience.
