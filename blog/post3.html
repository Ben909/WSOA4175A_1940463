        <h1>Data driven Storytelling</h1>

        <p>As with many words, an applicable definition of the word ‘story’ varies between communities based on the expectations and 
            contextual evidence inherent to the exposition of these stories. Beyond the expression of ideas or events, the design 
            principals of stories provide a cognitive overview about how we digest information. The engagement audiences receive from how 
            stories are mediated offers a level of discourse in association with the type of story or genre. Therefore, data storytellers 
            use innovative technologies to make their stories more engaging by relating the information to specific demographics or shared datasets (Tversky:2018).   
        </p>    
        <p> While the overarching principals of stories and data driven storytelling are the same, there is a difference in their manner 
            of execution. Graphics demand less guidance to how information is understood by the viewer.Graphical representations long predate the existence of written text. Initially,
            writing was used as a form of accounting to keep track of data. They are visually more inclined to 
            express the processes and behavioral patterns or ideas that require investigation. The interpretation of data sources reveals 
            stories that wouldn’t been found otherwise. Data driven stories are designed to empower us to find information that is relevant to 
            our community and individuality.
        </p>
        <p> One unique aspect inherent too all forms of graphics is their ability to convey direct information more efficiently than words.
            Charts or diagrams, for example, communicate through markers and attributes to meaningfully highlight and define certain 
            categories or hierarchies. This not only emphasizes important properties, but further reveals relevant information that the 
            researcher might not have been aware of or understood. It is imperative for the graphic designer to be aware of the factors which 
            influence the reception of their designs. Beyond the theoretical framework of their data analysis, the form and content of their 
            representations must be perceivable by the users. When presented with a comprehensible graphic design, users feel more encouraged to 
            engage with the content. Designers must therefore apply the three P’s principle when illustrating their work. They are: 
            Production, Preference and Performance (Tversky: 2018). Each of these elements function towards achieving systematic coherence with regard to
            graphical representations.
