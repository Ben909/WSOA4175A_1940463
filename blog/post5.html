        <h1>Artistic Data Visualization</h1>

        <p> Fernanda (2007) expresses that an actual definition of the term “artistic” visualization relies on the speculative factors which appropriates
            the data or imagery to relevant hierarchies. Furthermore, an adequate definition detaches itself from the concept of beauty or the 
            notion that visualizations are required to be “pretty”.  They are not just creative productions, but actually dynamic processes of 
            decision making based on a few basic principles.  Their creation is informed by the designer themselves and what they have to 
            communicate.  The designer must be cognizant of the reader as well, since they’re inclined to come up with their own assumptions, 
            biases and contexts for what they are presented. The visualization by itself should recognize information through evidence of how it 
            informs the truth about particular research theories. With the current software and tools at our disposal, there are countless methods 
            that can be used to develop sophisticated visualizations. This leads to a variety of stylized and new types of visualizations made 
            accessible through the internet. 
        </p>    
        <p> There is a lot of subconscious brain activity that occurs when we view new forms of information. We have evolved to identify and 
            make decisions based on the patterns that we are able to recognize. This is one of the advantages for the designer since it enables 
            them to rapidly communicate information through mediums that people have grown accustomed to. Designers craft visualizations with 
            the goal to elicit an emotional response from the viewer. We react to art and the aesthetics of a design piece as much as we react 
            to the information contained in it. So, when designers want their visualizations to leave an impact or to change a viewer’s 
            perspective, the format of visually representing information is an effective way to get them to engage with that information. It 
            allows the viewer to dig through a collection of data while merging key points and pieces of information to construct a clear narrative.
