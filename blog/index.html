            <p> As per the assignment brief, we are required to produce some form of data visualization using an existing API.
                The graphs below is facilitated by the open source library, <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> to illustrate the statistical distribution of recovered
                Covid-19 patients across all nine provinces of South-Africa. The concept for the chart is inspired by the times we life in.
                Amidst the pandemic, the current change in climate proves that more patients have recovered due to a lower chance for the
                virus to spread in warm weather temperatures. I therefore decided to create a chart which indicates which provinces had the 
                highest number of total recoveries. My idea was that this information could be used inform communities of strategies to combat the virus or 
                mitigate risk factors.For the purpose of this visualization, there are no databases where I can store this 
                information or keep it updated. Further development of this chart must be conducted within these considerations.  </p>
