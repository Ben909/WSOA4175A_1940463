        <h1>Concepts of Representation</h1>

        <p> The study of signs or ‘semiotics’ defines how we contextualize and perceive concepts that shape our reality.
            When we communicate to each other through the system of language, we use signs to produce different ideologies of how 
            concepts are recognized and how meaning is transferred across various cultures and mediums. These codes and conventions 
            facilitate our reception and understanding of signs through the context inherent in all forms of representation.
        </p>    
        <p> The signifier and signified function as two parts of the same whole. The signified essentially refers to the impression or
            thoughts that are produced in association with the form of the signifier. The signifier is the actual physical appearance 
            or features of the sign that refers to, an object, theory or symbol. Signs convey information and meaning through the 
            language that is used to represent symbols that are associated with cultures throughout history. 
            There are also dissimilarities in the language of how signifiers are arranged to create meaning. The arbitrary nature of the 
            sign according to Saussurean semiotics, suggests that the concepts of signifier and signified are connected in an arbitrary 
            way, meaning that there is no justifiable reason for them to be linked to each other. It is only based on convention that 
            there is a concept formed through the relationship of an object and its associated meanings. But this does not imply the same 
            conceptual idea for other cultural languages and their codes of meaning. There are no features of the signifier that makes it 
            resemble the signified beyond its form. 
        </p> 
        <p> The color black, for example, is a concept associated with various cultural meanings of race, fear, darkness or perhaps 
            suffering. However, these mental concepts are susceptible to change over time and attain new meaning in society, for example 
            “Black is Beautiful”. Signs are the foundation to the signifier that carry information on how we interpret concepts in a meaningful way.
