        <h1>What is Decolonisation?</h1>

        <p> There is much debate on how decolonisation of knowledge has established hierarchies of difference in contemporary society. The aim of decolonisation is to undo 
            mentalities that permeate government, education and media policies to purposefully regenerate native knowledge, epistemologies and ways of life (Keet, 2014). 
            History recognizes that Western ideologies or the Global North holds superiority over Southern powers concerning the development, production and dissemination of 
            knowledge. 
        </p>   
        
        
        <p> Mbembe (2015) exemplifies how the process of ‘demythologizing whiteness’ in universities restructures and reconciles the accumulation of knowledge, creativity 
            and the free will of individuals to perform within educational frameworks. Based on contextual evidence of the Cecil Rhodes statue, the practise of newly formulated 
            educational frameworks raises issues which relates to the disregard of original traditions and thoughts that created a functional system in the first place. Balance 
            is therefore crucial and offers the key to justify implementing strategies of decolonising knowledge.
        </p> 


        <p> The representation of politics in geo-political locations offer divisions between belonging to a nation fortified through the creation of a ‘nation-state’ and the 
            laws that govern the reproduction of knowledge. This refers to how the ‘colonized’ translates historical discourse and the legitimization of Western and European 
            thoughts and research practises. The decolonisation of knowledge seeks to eradicate these assumptions through the addition of new means and approaches to legitimize 
            knowledge. Mignolo emphasizes that the philosophy of decolonisation should encourage the addition of knowledge frameworks rather than removing the epistemic privilege 
            of the First World (Mignolo, 2009). Thereby we extend and repurpose that knowledge with the goal to gain more insight about it. We conduct research and measure outcomes 
            through the accumulation of information and data that is available to us. In terms of research output, science, maths and biology are perceived as the most legitimate 
            forms of knowledge in contemporary society because they aim to find universal laws and absolute truths that apply in all circumstances.
        </p>

        <p>The way we operate in these research fields often provides an historical, value free and objective understanding of society. Psychological research in neuroscience 
            for example, looks at differences in brain types of men and woman and how those types of ideas are reproduced and translated into different hierarchies which are 
            imbedded in society. It is important to challenge this idea of knowledge and to extend our own perspectives surrounding the development of new theories and approaches 
            on how knowledge is attained. 
        </p>

        <p>Within technology lies the power and the will to construct complex ideologies which reinforces certain cultural values and beliefs. These digital philosophies 
           often blur the lines of truth for the sake of other goals which leads to the spread of misguided information and the misrepresentation of certain social structures. 
           For example, games have a significant influence on the minds of players, both in young and old to associate serious topics such as criminality and violence with the 
           behaviour of certain cultural groups. This translation reveals the identities of stereotyped groups through how games communicate as a medium. While this may not be 
           the intended purpose of the game, it is the medium and provided technology that emphasizes and constructs these narratives into reality.
