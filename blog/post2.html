        <h1>Data Visualization Histories</h1>

        <p> In the earliest forms of data visualizations, scientists meant to record and measure living representations that offer 
            statistical value on how we view information. There is much debate on what is meant by the definition of data visualization. 
            We typically understand it as different ways of representing some form of collected data that helps us to make decisions or 
            navigate in the real world (Friendly: 2006). From the history of data visualizations, it becomes clear that these representations develop 
            how we communicate knowledge to provide a graphical overview of interrelated concepts.
        </p>
        <p> Geometric diagrams were one of the first data visualizations used to formulate maps and navigational structures for the 
            purpose of exploration. The expeditioners would use celestial coordinates to plot and depict locations as a standard form of 
            reference for their surveys. Later forms of geographical visualizations present a spherical view of the earth, where scientists 
            measure longitude through arcs or degrees to visualize day- and nighttime periods at various locations. These techniques of 
            measurement and observation in the Middle ages are evident in a number of topographical and statistical tables used by scholars 
            throughout the millennia. This expansion of analytic geometry and estimation broadened how scientists were able to visually 
            represent empirical data. The continued distribution of these visualizations resulted in new methods and theories of how 
            statistical data representations are be collected.
        </p>
        <p> The abstract development of graphs, along with technological innovations enabled the reproduction and dissemination of graphic 
            works by the year of 1794. (Friendly: 2006) At this stage, the accumulation of data forms progressed toward the development of modern 
            information sources such as atlases and comprehensive maps used to represent quantitative datasets. This would ultimately open the 
            door for new areas of examination as complex analysis of datasets gave rise to further developments on how we apply different forms 
            of data visualization. With refined administration, the representative value of graphic forms became more justified as comparisons 
            between datasets opened new dimensions for observation. By the years 1950 to 1975, research collaborations offered the means to produce widespread interactive applications which 
            featured command driven and statistical approaches to the collection of data sources (Friendly: 2006).
