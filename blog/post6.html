        <h1>Reflection on D3 Graph</h1>

        <p> Data visualizations are different from standard forms of infographics in the sense that they less one-dimensional and highly 
            dynamic or interactive with regard to how data is presented. The information should allow the viewer to see data in different 
            circumstances. Not only should the visualization present data, but it must also force the viewer to think about the bigger picture. 
            What is the visualization not representing? Each graph only looks a certain way because the data is based on a limited pool of 
            information. My visualization represents the total number of Covid-19 recoveries per province in South-Africa as of the 18th of 
            ctober. For this graph and the data that was used, I decided to use a bar chart since it communicates the various amounts of data 
            more effectively than the correlation made by a line chart. My experimentation with this bar chart revealed how different amounts 
            correlate to each other.  
        </p>    
        <p> The visualizations I attempted to create does not fully adhere to the principals and theories of representation or how to 
            communicate core ideas to the viewer. For future reference, I need to extend how each visualization represents information by 
            adding labels and text elements when users hover over areas of the chart. This should also make the visualizations more 
            interactive as a whole. In its current state, the graphs do not leave viewers with an interactive experience and the 
            information provided feels redundant. I must become more proficient in the ways D3 can be used to meaningfully express data.
