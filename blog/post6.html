        <h1>Digital Divide widens</h1>

        <p> In the wake of Covid 19, access to the internet has become a lifeline for millions of people. The digital divide reflects the gap in internet and technology access
            that prohibits people from participating in vital parts of society. This led to economic and social inequality which has an impact on the spread of information and 
            communication technologies. It is historically recognized that the integration of digitalization seeks to rectify the imbalance caused by the inability of low 
            socio-economic groups to be granted access to technology and its affordances. This is not helped by the manner in which Covid-19 has influenced the lives and opportunities 
            of individuals globally. “More than 1.5 billion students have been affected by school closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic” (Tataki & Glynos, 2020). As a result, the 
            most suitable and perhaps only solution for students to continue their academic curriculum came in the form of e-learning. This disruption has caused major disparities 
            in how educational resources are allocated and communicated to students who are expected to fulfil specific assessment standards. 
        </p>    

        <p> The pandemic has changed our awareness of the digital divide. This issue is emphasized through the fact that Covid-19 has widened the gap between those that have access to 
            modern technology versus those that do not. In a society where we are increasingly defined by our access to information, many are excluded and left in the digital dark age 
            because they are technologically illiterate or simply cannot afford to access internet services. According to The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
            Organization (UNESCO), 40% of students are unable to access the internet from home and only 50% of students have access to a computer while the other 830 million are left 
            disadvantaged with only a few possible solutions (Tataki & Glynos, 2020). These include making the internet accessible to places it’s never been before, and making the 
            service more accessible where it already exists. 
        </p>

        <p> With much of daily life moved online, the coronavirus pandemic dramatically exposed the digital divide and our continuous struggle to overcome it. While there are global 
            containment strategies to prevent further spreading of the virus, these should under no circumstances leave members of marginalized communities vulnerable. This is because
            neglect leaves these communities further seperated from bridging the digital divide while strategies to provide assistance is often overshadowed by the sheer scale of the gap 
            that already exists between communities.
        </p>

        <p> Amidst the pandemic, academic institutions face the challenges of transitioning to an unfamiliar online teaching environment. While the adaption to these new circumstances 
            might hinder the quality of education, teachers maintain their integrity to accommodate students who are vulnerable to unforeseen events such as the stability and 
            availability of technology in an online teaching space. Many strategies have been put in place to ensure students are given the best opportunities to succeed. According 
            to Correia (2020), clarity and open communication between instructors and learners are essential to ensure the success of support strategies such as access to free 
            resources and tools. The use of non-data related technologies is also encouraged since the majority has limited bandwidth and data as their disposal. While Covid invades 
            nearly every aspect of our world, it has forced us to reappropriate our response to the ever-present technological barrier of the digital divide.
