        <h1>Data Ethics</h1>

        <p> In the pursuit of knowledge, scholars conduct research encompassed by written, and unwritten rules that govern specific 
            expectations of one’s own and others’ behavior. Through introspection and social interaction, we develop an awareness of these 
            conformities and our cultural position within society. When we collect data, it is important to acknowledge and apply the ethical 
            principals that underline specific areas of study. These considerations include the application of moral rules and standardized 
            codes of conduct to the collection, analysis and dissemination of information about data. Additionally, data ethics considers how 
            and in what way sensitive data is maintained, shared, appropriated and analyzed. Examples of sensitive data include personally 
            identifiable information, such as human samples, surveys or DNA test results. 
        </p>    
        <p> It is important to consider data in ethics because we produce data every day. With the development of new technologies, 
            data is becoming increasingly more detailed especially in terms of how we interact with data. From an ethnical point of view, 
            we must be aware of the long- and short-term repercussions of data collection. With the birth of social media, we have become 
            accustomed to the ways content creators optimize various forms of media. This ranges from how we identify news headlines to 
            specific photo formats or even the way small sound bites maintain our attention for a short amount of time.  It changes our 
            behavior and how we consume content and as a result a lot of information gets taken out of context.The term ‘data’ implies 
            that something is given as non-factual information. The addition of text provides context which helps validate what the data 
            actually means. It promotes interpretation of the content through annotations which directs the users’ attention towards important 
            pieces of information (Diakopoulos: 2018). Ethically, the goal is to emphasize important information and avoid distractions or 
            misinterpretation of the data presented. This gives users more agency about the story and contextual evidence embedded in data visualizations.
