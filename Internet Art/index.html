            <p> This website focusses on art creation which takes form from the visual effects created by gradation. The technique uses a spectrum of colour volumes, space and 
                atmosphere to illustrate gradual transitions of one or more colours to another set of colour hues. The tools to create these effects are extremely powerful and 
                versatile when it comes to methods of manipulating properties such as blending or shading. The creation and dissemination of these artworks shares knowledge about 
                the theories discussed in ‘The Work of Art in the Age of the Internet’. The unique aura that is now replaced and embodied by its reproductions will be highlighted 
                in terms of how modern tools are used to create a completely unique feel to designs. A Combination of subtle and bold designs will be used as a focal point to 
                express depth to an otherwise flat design. The use gradients with any other artwork creates endless possibilities to the emphasize colours, textures and shapes 
                of the original artwork. This exposes audiences to alternative modern art that feels fresh or possibly visually overwhelming. </p>
